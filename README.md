📊🔮 Stock Price Forecasting Using LSTM Neural Networks
Welcome to our project on Stock Price Forecasting using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) — a deep learning-based approach to predict stock prices by learning from historical time-series data.

This project was completed by Shivendra, blending financial theory with Python, PyTorch, and machine learning.

🚀 Project Overview
In this project, we:

Simulated stock market behavior using synthetic time-series data (sine waves + trend + noise).

Preprocessed the data using MinMaxScaler for optimal model performance.

Built an LSTM-based neural network using PyTorch to capture temporal dependencies.

Trained, validated, and visualized the model's performance on time-series forecasting.

Predicted future values to simulate real-world stock forecasting applications.
